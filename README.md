# Teams-Clone
A working prototype with video call functionality built under Microsoft Engage Mentorship Program.
The purpose of this project is to build a working prototype where more that one users can chat and have video conference with others.
I have used NodeJS, ExpressJS , MomentJS , Socket.IO , WEBRTC ,PeerJS , UUID (to generate random urls for meetings) along with HTML and CSS .
I would like to thank Mr.Osho Bajpai and Mr.Rohan Ankarigari for their constant help and support.
